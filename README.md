Assumptions and Requirements:
------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 Rest API's in this event booking system. They are:
1. bookTicket- This API is responsible for booking the ticket and storing the details in the database
2. getTicketByID- This API is responsible for viewing the list of tickets for a particular ID. The values will be retrieved from the database.
3. deleteTicketById- This API is responsible for deleting the ticket based on the ID's.

For this project we are using hibernate as ORM for storing and retrieving the records from the database.
